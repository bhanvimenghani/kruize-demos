# Kruize Monitoring Demo

Kruize Monitoring provides actionable optimized resource recommendations at container and namespace level based on application performance. 

## Monitoring Modes

Kruize Monitoring supports two modes:

- **Local Monitoring Mode**  
  Monitor your applications within your own environment and generate the recommendations by deploying it locally. [More details on Local Monitoring](https://github.com/kruize/autotune/blob/master/design/KruizeLocalAPI.md).

- **Remote Monitoring Mode**  
  Leverage data gathered from remote clusters to generate resource recommendations. This mode is ideal if you want to centralize monitoring for multiple clusters. [More details on Remote Monitoring](https://github.com/kruize/autotune/blob/master/design/MonitoringModeAPI.md)


## How to Use This Demo

1. Select the appropriate monitoring mode for your environment.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the respective directory for either local or remote mode.
3. Begin monitoring your applications and review the generated resource recommendations.
